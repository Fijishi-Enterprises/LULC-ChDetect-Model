## A land-use and land-cover disaggregation and change detection model

## Current release
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/101879773.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/101879773)

## Overview
Demeter is an open source Python package that was built to disaggregate projections of future land allocations generated by an integrated human-Earth systems model.  Projected land allocation from IAMs is traditionally transferred to Earth System Models (ESMs) in a variety of gridded formats and spatial resolutions as inputs for simulating biophysical and biogeochemical fluxes. Existing tools for performing this translation generally require a number of manual steps which introduces error and is inefficient.  Demeter makes this process seamless and repeatable by providing gridded land use and land cover change (LULCC) products derived directly from an IAM—in this case, the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM)—in a variety of formats and resolutions commonly used by ESMs.  Demeter is publicly available via GitHub and has an extensible output module allowing for future ESM needs to be easily accommodated.    

## Installation
The following step will get Demeter ready to use:
1.  This repository uses the Git Large File Storage (LFS) extension (see https://git-lfs.github.com/ for details).  Please run the following command before cloning if you do not already have Git LFS installed:
`git lfs install`
2.  Clone Demeter into your desired location git clone https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/demeter.git`
3.  From the directory you cloned Demeter into run `python setup.py install` .  This will install Demeter as a Python package on your machine and install of the needed dependencies.
4.  Setup your configuration file (.ini).  Examples are located in the "example" directory.  Be sure to change the root directory to the directory that holds your data (use the 'demeter/example' directory as an example).
5. If running Demeter from an IDE:  Be sure to include the path to your config file.  See the "demeter/example/example.py" script as a reference.
6. If running Demeter from terminal:  Run model.py found in demeter/demeter/model.py passing the full path to the config file as the only argument. (e.g., `python model.py /users/ladmin/repos/github/demeter/example/config.ini`)

If a permissions error is encountered either run the command sudo or on Windows open cmd as an administrator.

## Setup
Demeter requires the setup of several input files to begin a run.  Examples of all input files can be found in the ‘examples’ directory and the expected file structure is outlined in the following:

-	Example directory
    -   Inputs directory
        -	Allocation directory
            -	Constraint weighting file
                -	GCAM landclass allocation file
                -	Kernel density weighting file
                -	Spatial landclass allocation file
                -	Transition priority file
                -	Treatment order file
        -	Observed spatial data directory
            -	Observed spatial data file
        -	Constraint data directory
            -	Constraint files
        -	Projected GCAM land allocation directory
            -	GCAM land allocation file
        -	Reference data directory
            -	Reference files

The following describes the requirements and format of each input.

### Observed spatial data:

This file represents the area in square degrees of each land class existing within a grid cell.  The grid cell size is defined by the user.  This file must be presented as a comma-separated values (CSV) file having a header in the first row and must contain the field names and fields described in Table 1.


|   Field	|   Description   |         
| --------- | --------------- |
| fid | Unique integer ID for each grid cell latitude, longitude |
| landclass | Each land class field name (e.g., shrub, grass, etc.).  Field names must not include commas. |
| region_id	| The integer ID of the GCAM region that the grid cell is contained in.  Exact field name spelling required. |
| metric_id	| The integer ID of the GCAM AEZ or basin that the grid cell is contained in.  Exact field name spelling required. |
| latitude | The geographic latitude value of the grid cell centroid as a signed float.  Exact field name spelling required. |
| longitude	| The geographic longitude value of the grid cell centroid as a signed float.  Exact field name spelling required. |

**Table 1.**  Observed spatial data required fields and their descriptions.

### Projected land allocation data:

This file is the formatted GCAM run output for land allocation projections.  Since the format of this file can vary based on GCAM user preference, the file must be formatted to meet Demeter input requirements as described in Table 2.  The file must be a CSV file having the header in the first row.

| Field	| Description |
| --- | --- |
| region	| The text name of the GCAM region. Exact field name spelling required. |
| landclass | Each land class field name (e.g., shrub, grass, etc.).  Field names must not include commas. |
| year | Each year of the GCAM run as an integer (e.g., 2005, 2010, etc.) |
| metric_id |	The integer ID of the GCAM AEZ or basin.  Exact field name spelling required. |

**Table 2.** Projected land allocation required fields from GCAM.

### Allocation files:

#### *Constraint weighting:*

A weight for each constraint, with a value ranging from -1.0 to 1.0, can be applied to each land class.  If no constraints are desired, a user should simply provide a header-only file.  For example, for a given land class, the weight for the soil quality constraint with a value of -1 indicates that one land class is fully constrained inversely (e.g., grasslands are opportunistic and grow readily in areas with a low soil quality); a weight of 0 indicates that soil quality exerts no constraint to the land class (e.g., forest, etc.); a weight of 1 for soil quality indicates that high soil quality will highly influence where the type will be spatially allocated (e.g. cropland).  These constraints are developed in separate files as described in the following Constraints section.  See the constraint weighting file in the example inputs for reference.

#### *Kernel density weighting:*

Weight the degree to which land classes subjected to a kernel density filter will be utilized during expansion to each class.  Value from 0.0 to 1.0. See the kernel density weighting file in the example inputs for reference.

#### *Transition Priority:*

This ordering defines the preferential order of final land allocation (e.g., crops expanding into grasslands rather than forests).  See the priority allocation file in the example inputs for reference.  See the priority allocation file in the example inputs for reference.  

#### *Treatment order:*

Defines the order in which final land classes are downscaled.  This will influence the results (e.g., if crops are downscaled first and overtake grassland, grassland will not be available for shrubs to overtake when processing shrub land).  See the treatment order file in the example inputs for reference.

#### *Observational spatial data class allocation:*

This file defines how the land-use and land-cover classes in the OSD will be binned into final land classes for output, which can be defined by the user and serve to place projected land allocation data from GCAM on a common scale with the on-the-ground representation of land-use and land-cover represented in the OSD.  See the Observed spatial data class allocation file in the example inputs for reference.

#### *Projected land class allocation:*

This file defines how the land-use and land-cover classes in the GCAM projected land allocation data will be binned into final classes.  See the projected land class allocation file in the example inputs for reference.   

#### *Constraints (not required):*

As discussed earlier, constraints such as soil quality may be desirable to the user and can be prepared by assigning a weighted value from 0.0 to 1.0 for each grid cell in the OSD. Spatial maps of constraints should be provided by the user for application during the downscaling process. Users should note that constraining a grid cell to 0.0 may impede the ability to be able to achieve a projected land allocation from GCAM since land area is being excluded that GCAM expects.  Each constraint file must have two fields:  fid and weight.  The fid field should correspond to the fid field in the OSD input and the weight field should be the weight of the constraint per the cell corresponding to the OSD input.  Each file should be a CSV with no header.

## Workflow

Figure 1 details the Demeter’s workflow once the input files have been prepared.  The process can be outlined as follows:

1.	Configuration file read and input parameters are validated
2.	Input data is read and validated
3.	Grid area discrepancies between the OSD and the projected land allocation from GCAM are harmonized by adjusting the GCAM allocation areas using a correction factor (ratio of the OSD land use data per region and metric to the projected area from GCAM)
4.	Constraints are processed if provided and prepared for integration
5.	The convolution filter that will be used to calculate kernel density is prepared.  This is applied during each time step.
6.	Initial and time step specific arrays are prepared
7.	An initial pass to intensify existing land is conducted
8.	An expansion pass is conducted to apply land allocation projections where the kernel density probabilities meet the user-specified selection threshold.
9.	A final intensification pass is conducted to allocate any land projections not yet met.
10.	Output products are created.

## Execution

Demeter has two main model level functions available to the user:  `execute()` and `ensemble()`.  The execute function allows the user to run Demeter based on the parameters defined in the configuration file and as set up in the input files.  This is the most common use of Demeter.  The ensemble function was built to allow the user to test Demeter using random configurations of the transition priorities, treatment order, intensification ratio, selection threshold, and kernel distance.  The ensemble section of the configuration file as seen in the example directory give the user the ability to define the number of permutations that they wish to evaluate as well as a limits file that gives the user the ability to set limits and the interval at which intensification ratio, selection threshold, and kernel distance will be evaluated.  The initial state of the configuration file and input files are used to create a template by which every unique combination of the aforementioned parameters can be generated.  A uniquely random sample of these configurations are then chosen based upon how many permutations the user wishes to evaluate.  Each Demeter run is then executed in parallel based on the number of jobs the user has set.

### Installation
Installing Demeter can be conducted as follows:

1.	This repository uses the Git Large File Storage (LFS) extension (see https://git-lfs.github.com/ for details). Please run the following command before cloning if you do not already have Git LFS installed: git lfs install
2.	Clone Demeter into your desired location git clone https://github.com/IMMM-SFA/demeter.git`
3.	Install the Python package setuptools (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) if the package is not already on your machine.
4.	From the directory you cloned Demeter into and your setup.py file exists run python setup.py install which will install Demeter as a Python package on your machine and install of the required dependencies.

### Run Preparation
Prepare Demeter for a run as follows:

1.	Setup your configuration file (.ini). Examples are located in the "example" directory. Be sure to change the root directory to the directory that holds your data (use the 'demeter/example' directory as an example).
2.	If running Demeter from an IDE: Be sure to include the path to your config file. See the "demeter/example/example.py" script as a reference.
3.	If running Demeter from terminal: Run model.py found in demeter/demeter/model.py passing the full path using forward slashes and having no spaces to the configuration file as the first argument and either “standard” or “ensemble” as the second argument (e.g., python model.py /users/<uname>/github/demeter/example/config.ini standard)

Both the output directory and log file generated during runtime are named per the run scenario and the timestamp of when the run began.  An additional suffix of the permutation number will also be added if using the ensemble function in Demeter.  All other outputs directories are named according to what the user specifies in the configuration file.

## Quality control

All possible combinations of the configuration file and input files have been tested.  Strict requirements for input files are documented.  Configuration options have set limits, values, and types and are validated during runtime. An example setup for Demeter is included in the package.  The example has a configuration file and an input directory containing all other necessary files.  To setup the provided example, the user should simply change the file paths in the configuration file and the example.py file to represent their local directories.

Demeter outputs the following diagnostic files that help the user to evaluate the outputs based on how they were processed during runtime:
- Harmonization coefficient NumPy array
- This file contains the correction factor that was applied to each grid cell of the projected land allocation data to ensure the projected area is the same as the area actually available as represented by the OSD for the target base year
- Files for each intensification and expansion pass detailing the land change per year per grid cell from one landclass to its transition class by region and metric
- A detailed log file
- A suite of tabular, spatial, and mapped data.
